### Programming - II
 In this repository you can find issues related to topics of each module as mentioned below, as well as practical examples used in the computer science course.
 
### Unitis
The course is divided into 3 units.

- [x] Unit 01 - General language domain
- [x] Unit 02 - OOP in C++
- [x] Unit 03 - Best practices in C++

* Unit 1: Introduction to C++, fundamental concepts, structures, pointers, dynamic allocation.
* Unit 2: Classes concept, encapsulation, access modifiers, variable scope,objects, constructors and destructors, aggregation, inheritance and polymorphism.
* Unit 3: Exceptions, namespace, compilation and execution, generic programming,
entrance and exit.

### To compile a C++ program, run:
```
g++ -o file_name file_name.cpp
```
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor used
* [Doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) - Documentation to learn how to use c++ in Vscode

### How it works

Code repository for Programming (II) classes of the computer science course. Programming subject 2 is focused on the object-oriented programming paradigm, using the C++ language.
